Data in transit:

Actively moving data from one location to another. This can be over the internet, the intranet, or my favorite sneaker net(hand-carrying).  Data in motion is often considered less secure because the user does not maintain positive control of the data.


Data at Rest

Data that is not actively moving form one location to another. Often data at rest is considered more valuable to attackers and at the same time can be considered less vulnerable than data in motion.  



Regardless of the state of the data, best practices are needed to secure data as attackers become more capable in stealing data.  Encryption is often the most effective protection for both states of data. 

Best practices:
•	good network security.
•	be proactive and not reactive
•	implement user prompting, blocking, automatic encryption.
•	classify data according to sensitivity and appropriate policies to protect the data.  Don’t use a $50,000 solution to protect a $5 piece of data.
Risk profile determines the appropriate level of protection.
