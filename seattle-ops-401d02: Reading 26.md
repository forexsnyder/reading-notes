 # Cyber security automation
 
Automate repetitive and mundane tasks. SOAR and RPA take it further.  Configure a 
	
preplanned response to incidents.  RPA tools are broader 
  
and allow for multiple types of processes to be automated.  Not just security. 

 # Why Automation
 
Increase in technical complexities of their business environment.  This can lead to

an increase in risk if cybersecurity does not keep up with the growth.  Data is 

growing at rates that cannot be processed manually and automation is the solution.  
  
Cybersecurity incidents are too hard to catch without some form of automation.

# Benefits of Automation

Off loading the workload to a system that does not sleep or get tired.  Capable of

sorting and organizing data faster.  Frees cybersecurity professionals to

focus on other projects.

Successfully Integrate Automation:
1. Place developers in the cybersecurity team.
2. Partner cybersecurity with organizational teams.
3. Adopt a hybrid approach.
