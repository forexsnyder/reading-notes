STRIDE framework
Threat modeling in the beginning can help address blind spots.


Spoofing
Claiming to be someone you are not.  This can happen in common authentication methods. How do you know the identity can be trusted?  
  Common components needed to spoof:
  Single key
  Access token
  Signatures

Tampering
Data tampering often coincides with other potential threats.  Firewalls, partiioned storage are common methods to detect tampered data.

Repudiation
Being able to deny you were the person that performed the action.  


Information Disclosure
There is a large attack surface for data disclosure.  A good security program can help reduce the risk of data disclosure.  Encryption is the biggest deterent for data disclosure.
Good training and policy can help prevent inadvertent data disclosure.

Denial Of Service
Availability affected by DoS.  Redundancy, load balancing, and firewalls can help mitigate against DoS and DDoS.

Elevation Of Privilege
Spoofing is authentication, elevation is related to authorization.
A sophisticated attack will combine other areas of the STRIDE models. Lack of an audit trail can cause repudiation and info disclosure without trace.  

Purpose of STRIDE is to be able to evaluate your system and identify potential threats before they take place.
