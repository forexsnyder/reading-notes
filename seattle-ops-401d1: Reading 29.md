Threat hunting:

Searching the network for signs of compromise.

Active/Proactive instead of reactive.

Results driven as opposed to alerts driven. Threat hunting is not responding
 to an incident it is looking for it.  Results are looking at target behavior
 and not “signatures”.  Search should be as wide and far on the network as possible.
 
The purpose of threat hunting:

There is a gap between protection of the system and response to a compromise. 
Threat hunting seeks to identify compromises sooner and quicker.  Typically, it
can take 6 months to discover an intruder on the network if threat hunting is
not taking place regularly.
