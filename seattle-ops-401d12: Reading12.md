Intrusion detection systems:
raise awareness by identifying threats and incidents.
a visibility tool that monitors network traffic.  When traffic matching a signature, an alarm is raised.

IDS vs IPS
IPS takes action, an IDS notifies.  IPS can block legit traffic if not tuned properly.

NIDS vs HIDS
NIDS monitor traffic on the network.  HIDS monitors a host (hardware).  Both should be used as part of an overall security system.

Pros of NIDS
Tuning to specific threats
They Can Look at Data in the Context of the Protocol
They Can Qualify and Quantify Attacks
They Make It Easier to Keep Up With Regulation
They Can Boost Efficiency

Cons of Network Intrusion Detection Systems
They Will Not Prevent Incidents By Themselves
An Experienced Engineer Is Needed to Administer Them
They Do Not Process Encrypted Packets
IP Packets Can Still Be Faked
False Positives Are Frequent
They Are Susceptible to Protocol Based Attacks
The Signature Library Needs to Be Continually Updated to Detect the Latest Threats
