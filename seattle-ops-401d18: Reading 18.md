Application Threat Modeling

Applies to a variety of technologies.  It works to identify, communicate, understand threats, and how to mitigate the risks.  The earlier in SDLC the better.

What:
A checklist of what the model should do.

Why:
Reduce the exposure to a threat.  


1. What are we building?
2. What can go wrong?
3. What are we going to do about that?
4. Did we do a good enough job?


Process:
Modern threat modelling building blocks fit well into agile and are in wide use.
When to Threat model:
When the system changes, consider impact to security.
Threat modelling: engagement vs review:
Whiteboarding= exchange of ideas, can be transferred to a high-quality presentation for review later.
